# The Light Child (Ludum Dare 46 Compo Submission)

This is a game I made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 46 game jam (Theme: "Keep it alive"). 

See my entry [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/the-light-child) and play it [here](https://hulien22.itch.io/ldjam46).

Made using Godot and Aseprite.
